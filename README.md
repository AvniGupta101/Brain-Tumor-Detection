## Overview

This project uses deep learning (CNNs) to classify MRI brain scan images into categories (e.g. *tumor* vs *no tumor*). The aim is to build a model that can assist in detecting brain tumors in MRI images with high accuracy.

---

## Features

- Preprocessing of MRI images (resizing, normalization, data augmentation)  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (or other architectures)  
- Training with train/validation split  
- Model performance evaluation (accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score)  
- Visualization of results (e.g. confusion matrix, ROC curve)  
- Saving and loading the trained model  

---

## Dataset

Describe where your MRI images come from, for example:

- Source: (insert dataset source, e.g. open dataset like *Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS)* or another public dataset)  
- Number of images: how many total, how many in each class (tumor / no tumor)  
- Format: image format (e.g. `.jpg`, `.png`), image size
